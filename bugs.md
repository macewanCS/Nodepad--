This is the file for the known bugs inside of the EPL ticketing System

* Going back from viewing a branch ticket when show all was selected in the dropdown will make it default to home branch but not update the dropdown
* We experienced a database issue on one computer with firefox, so this app was primarily developed with Google Chrome. It should still function well on firefox, but some unexpected bugs may occur.
* Not all tickets seeded in the database work perfectly with the view ticket screen. To see how that screen functions it is best to use tickets that are created with our system.
