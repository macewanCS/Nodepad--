#EPL Ticketing System

Our goal is to create a web application that allows EPL workers to create tickets online, which will be inserted into their current database system.

This system will be written in JavaScript using the Nodejs framework.

#Using the Ticketing System

#General Design

Our system will be designed similarly to the design of the [EPL website] (https://www.epl.ca/). This should give our targetted audience, EPL workers, some baseline familiarity with the system.

#How a User Navigates the Site

A user will be able to click the links in the header of the page to browse between the different screens on the site.

A user will also be able to navigate the site from the footer.

##Logging in

When you first navigate to the site, you will be prompted to login using a username and password. You must have a previously created EPL account to login to the system. 

This initial page also has the option to let a user recover a forgotten password.

After a succesful login, a user will be brought to the home screen.

##Home Screen

This screen will provide a brief overview of each of the other screens in the application. 

A user will be able to see recent announcements, tickets they created, and tickets from their branch. 

They will also be able to see some general help that could help them solve their issue before submitting a ticket. 

##Viewing Personal Tickets

The system will allow a user to view all of their submitted tickets by clicking on the My Tickets screen. 

This page will display in a tabular fashion, all of the relevant information for the ticket displayed. 

A user will have the ability to sort tickets based on the categories that the product owner has specified, and be able to search through the tickets by keyword. 

From this page there will also be the ability to edit the Ticket and self close the ticket.

  * **Editing a Ticket**
  There will be required fields that must be filled before a user can submit any edits.   As well, a user will be shown a screen confirming their submission.
  * **Closing a Ticket**
  A user can resolve their ticket, but will be required to enter their solution to the problem before it can be resolved.

##Viewing Branch Tickets

A user wil be able to see tickets made at their branch by navigating to the Branch Tickets screen. This will include open and closed tickets.

This screen will be similar to the individual ticket screen in design. Searching will be accomplished in the same way as the my tickets screen.

##Submitting a ticket

The system will allow a user to submit a ticket into the HEAT database.  

There will be mandatory fields that a user must fill out.

There will be five categories for users to choose from when creating a ticket.

**Categories**
  * Software
  * Hardware
  * Password
  * Service
  * General
  
  
Each of the categories will have different mandatory information to be filled in, which will require a different form.

####Mandatory information table

Category | Required Information | Non-Required information | Example
--------- | -------------------- | ----------------------  | ----------
Password Reset | System, Account/Username | N/A | I forgot my password and need it reset
Hardware Issue | Equipment Type, Description of the problem | Asset Tag, Computer/Device name, Error Messages | My laptop screen is cracked
